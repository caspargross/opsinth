- [ ] Define what to do with female samples (haploid X)
- [ ] Write correct seq name into BAM for denovo seq
- [ ] Add edit distance to BAM tags
- [ ] Output racon polishing stats to text file instead of log?
- [ ] Better object oriented programming. Results class.
- [ ] Create Plot with https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/DnaFeaturesViewer
- [ ] Create comparative plot to ref with https://github.com/moshi4/pyGenomeViz
- [ ] Plot linear regression for alignment Quality (Edit distance). Maybe show in Plots
- [ ] Maybe remove BED file for target region and take from anchor range instead? Test this out!
- [ ] Add pytests
- [ ] Add to Bioconda
- [ ] Create new reference alignments as GTF
- [ ] Call variants (paftools.js) and return in VCF format
- [ ] Find SVs (SVIM?)
- [ ] Benchmark overlap ref creation scoring scheme
- [X] Filter out reads with edit distance > 15% of read length
- [X] Create draft seq from overlapping reads if no spanning are available. Improved
- [X] Try to align double anchored reads in reverse orientation: Fixed by using low and high anchor
- [X] Create racon polishing performance output plot
- [X] Find a way to add racon for multiple platforms. Takes from path.
- [X] Integrate output from Paraphase: Not needed
- [X] Indel Realignment / Merging in edlib alignments required: Replaced by Racon consensus!
- [X] Fix overhanging read ends for long reads. Maybe use softclips? Or cut to roi before alignment?
- [X] Polish consensus (racon)
- [X] Fix coverage plot for denovo seq
- [X] What is up with seqs that completely fail to map?: Else with "continue 
- [X] Multiple alignments for reads without anchors: Always use first
- [X] Write fasta for denovo seq
- [X] Generate new ref by overlapping reads
- [X] Find overlapping longest reads
- [X] Fix read orientation for WGS anchors
- [X] Add @PG line to bamfile
- [X] Create BAM index
- [X] Fix Alignment Quality plot
- [X] Better output / logging to stdout
- [X] Add IGV image generation / include IGV-Web
